# React Calculator

This directory was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and contains a
simple React implementation of a calculator. The app requires **Node.js 14.17.3**
or later. If you use `nvm`, run `nvm use` to activate the version specified in
`.nvmrc`.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – create a production build in `dist`
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint on the source files

You normally don't need to touch the rest of the files generated by Vite unless
you want to customize the build further.

The calculator UI includes `(` and `)` buttons for grouping as well as
advanced functions (`1/x`, `x!`, `x^2`, `x^y`, `√`) for more complex
calculations. The memory value is shown in the top-left corner and the `MS`
and `MR` buttons are disabled until something has been stored.
Recent results are appended to a history panel beside the calculator.
